    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>As a young child, all I have ever wanted to do was help people in whatever way I can. 4 years later I learn that the world is starving, and that harmful ingredients are being added to food, such as food dye, MSG, and too many more. So, I set out on a mission, and that mission was to feed everyone with food. Good food. Healthy, non-malicious food. Thatâ€™s how I came up with HealthiFoods. I only hope that what you eat comes from my buisness, because my buisness stays on the green side of good food.</p>
